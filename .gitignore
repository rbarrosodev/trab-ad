# pyenv
#   For a library or tool, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you don't use Pipfile.lock, it's better to ignore it.
# Pipfile.lock
